# Marquis Menu
To get started, run `python server.py` to get the current day's menu.

To look up a specific date, run `python -d server.py <month> <day>`

If the cache file isn't present in the same directory during the first run of `server.py`, then the menu for the term is scraped from the official website. Once it's done, menus can looked up locally.

The Marquis Hall menu for the appropriate date is displayed and will look something similar to these images.

| Specific date                      |  Current date                    |
